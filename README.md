# Customer_Churn_Prediction

*	This project predicts customer churn. First I performed EDA to understand and visualize the data. 
*	I did data preprocessing and then used various ML Algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and various others. Finally, I used Voting Classifier to make an ensemble of all the models.
*	Separately, I also build a Aritificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict churn and compare itâ€™s performance with the above algorithms.
*	Tech Stack used: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (Keras)
